# Analysis process for the PCL1 Course Project:
## Automatic Plot Analysis

###### Group: Mert Erol, Andrea Scheck

# --- Part 3: Visualization:
For the results from Part 2, we did simple line plots to track the emotions of the main characters across the chapters.
We also overlapped the line plots and compared these results with the content of the book.
Additionally, we created box plots which allow us more insight into outliers and the distribution of data in detail.
For the results from Part 0, we tracked the occurences of positive and negative emotions across the entire book.

# --- Part 4: Reflection and Discussion
Our learning experience, project insights, and real-world applicability.

a) Learning and Challenges
* Comparing the results of grep and the more in-depth NLP analysis, what are the key insights?
The grep for part 0 probably was much better at capturing all occurences, as it was simpler. The more context we had to add (to capture entire sentences with the main character names, the 

* You were asked to visualise both methods. How do they differ?

* Summarize key learnings, focusing on technical skills and literary insights.

* Briefly discuss major challenges and how you addressed them, particularly moving from basic grep searches to advanced NLP.


b) Analysis Insights and Real-World Applicability
* Describe significant insights from the book analysis and how advanced NLP tools enhanced your initial grep findings.

* Reflect on how these techniques and insights could apply in real-world contexts, like social media analysis or other literary works.


# --- Feedback

The project was very interesting overall. However the instructions were not given in a  clear way and this led to quite a lot of frustration. For example, in part 1 and 2, we tried to apply our code to all 3 books and only found out quite late that we could have picked just 1. Also, the comparison between the results of part 0 and part 2 in part 3 did not seem sensible because the instructions for creating the results for part 0 were too ambigious. Of course we came up with something to compare, but it really did not feel very worthwile. If we'd been instructed in part 0 to grep the names and sentiments together, we could have avoided this.
